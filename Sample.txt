Anonymous function  :  lambda
			

data cleaning package :  mice




regression analysis : supervised machine learning - linear regression

residual errors  :  deviates from output (hidden errors)

null hypothesis : negative assumption

alternate hypothesis : positive assumption

p<@ : reject null hypothesis

akaikea information criteria - AIC

bayesian information criteria - BIC

if AIC is low then consider that model

if AIC is eaual then compare BIC

If BIC is high then consider that model



order(x) = 13*1
order(y) = 13*1

matrix multiplication is not possible

so we apply reshaping for transposing
